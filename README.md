# Java-Piano-Program
This is my Java Piano Program that I made during my junior year of high school! It uses an applet in order to display the GUI for this program and is meant to represent an online piano. When you click on the keys, they make a sound and there is a special button that will change the piano keys to the voice of my Computer Science teach saying random words! Enjoy!
